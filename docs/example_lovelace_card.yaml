# Example Lovelace setup polling the agent's incident endpoint.
#
# Define a REST sensor in configuration.yaml:
# sensor:
#   - platform: rest
#     name: incident_bundles
#     resource: http://localhost:8000/incidents
#     scan_interval: 30
#
# Then add this card to your dashboard:
type: markdown
title: Agent Incidents
content: |
  {% set incidents = states('sensor.incident_bundles') | from_json %}
  {% for inc in incidents %}
  - {{ inc }}
  {% endfor %}
